# To DeepL

Chrome extension. Highlight text on a web page and send it to DeepL.
I'm not planning publish this extension to chrome store

This extension is clone of firefox extension "[To DeepL](https://github.com/rewkha/firefox-to-deepl)"

## How to manually setup .crx files:

- Go to chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling
- Change Handling of extension MIME type requests to `Always prompt for install`. (This makes it more user friendly to install .crx files, which are the packed version of chromium extensions)
- Sometimes you need to restart your browser if next steps not working
- Now, in the address bar, type chrome://extensions
- Turn on developer mode
- Drag and drop crx file to this screen
